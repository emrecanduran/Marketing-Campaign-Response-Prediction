### Goals  
This project aims to develop a prediction model for the Marketing Department of a retail company to predict which customers are likely to respond to a marketing campaign based on information from a previous campaign. A response model can significantly enhance the efficiency of a marketing campaign by increasing responses or reducing expenses.
